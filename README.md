# FlyIO.NET 🚀

A minimal Blazor Server app deployed on [Fly.Io](https://fly.io) — no CI pipelines, no cloud dashboards, no drama.

This project was built as a small side experiment to explore Blazor and see how simple (or painful) deploying a .NET app could be in 2025. Turns out... it was easier than expected.

---

## ✨ What This Is

A basic Blazor Server template created with:

`dotnet new blazorserver -o FlyIo.NET`

Then deployed live with just a few Fly.io CLI commands. No Kubernetes, no overengineering.

---

## 🚀 How to Deploy It Yourself

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [.NET SDK 8+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)
- [Fly.io CLI (`flyctl`)](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/)

Then:

```
git clone https://github.com/irimescucosmin/FlyIo.NET.git
cd FlyIo.NET`
```

```
flyctl auth login 
flyctl launch
```

Fly.Io will detect the .NET project, generate the config files, and guide you through the rest.

After a short build, you’ll get a live URL like:

`https://your-app-name.fly.dev`

---

## 🧾 Files Generated by Fly.io

After the first `flyctl launch`, Fly.io adds:

- `fly.toml`: App configuration (region, app name, port, etc.)
- `Dockerfile`: Used to containerize and deploy your .NET app

You don’t have to write these yourself — Fly.Io takes care of it. But you’re free to customize them later.

## 💭 Why This Project?

I wanted to deploy something quickly, without setting up a full DevOps pipeline or subscribing to a cloud dashboard.  
Fly.io felt like the modern version of FTP — just smarter.
